# Vim-Advantages

> [!WARNING]
> I do not reccomend using this project, as basic shortcuts and semantics change during development. The readme is incomplete. Parameters are missing, and many functions and to-dos are not synchronized.

* The Main Goal Is Programming Intuitively In The Terminal.
* The Userexperience Needs Improvement - This Project Is Not Recommended So Far
* The scripts sometimes throw errors.
* The current state is unstable.
* A standard set of keyboard shortcuts is provided, but can be easily customized for efficient programming in Linux environments.

#### Linux
```
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vi0lin/vim-advantages/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash -s -- debug
```

#### Windows
```
curl -o install.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vi0lin/vim-advantages/refs/heads/main/install.sh
"C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe" .\install.sh
```
```
curl -o install.sh -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vi0lin/vim-advantages/refs/heads/main/install.sh wsl --install
wsl bash install.sh
del install.sh
```

#### Vim Plug
```
call plug#begin()
  Plug 'vi0lin/vim-advantages'
call plug#end()

      <td colspan=3>The FZF binary-call bottlenecks with a bad interface.<br>On <code>Enter</code> Key, it only delivers the file path, that then can possibily be saved in a temporary file.<br>
        That means there is no good solution for archieving further functionality, but retrieving the FZF found file or files in a list.<br>
        Handling keystrokes, like vims popup_create function, are less programmable with FZF.<br>
        Therefore I implement the directory traversing myself.<br>
        <code>Enter</code> opens a file, or goes into a Folder.<br>
        <p>
        Moving towards and away from the cached target is possibile. This simply changes the CWD of the current buffer. And filechecking within the current directory is simply made.</p>

- [ ] save this in .vim-advantage of $current_project
- [ ]   ,f1 / fzf trough commands / ,t enables tabwide / ,b enables bufferwise / vim commands are also selectable 
- [ ]   creates a .vim-advantages file in the dir / that gets read
- [ ]     saves the commands that are defined bufferwise/filewise/cwdwise/tabwise/global / i dont know
- [ ]       they have a priority value which decides which of them are going to be executed first, when there are multiple commands on a key
- [ ]       f1 f1 twice, will fire the second command.
- [ ]       when multiple commands are on one key, the command will be executed after a timeout
- [ ]     (you could also search the whole system for .vim-advantage files)
- [ ]     (save them in a list / for quicker access)
- [ ]     {and feed the list, when you find one, or delete, when its not present)
- [ ]     f1 when no command is assigned, you can choose one with fzf
- [ ]     commands are are globally stored / somewhere in .vim-commands for now

- [ ]     bash snippets are saved in the working directory of the current opened file in .vim-advantages json "filename": [ "compile1": "gcc $var -o program program.c", "compile2": "gcc $var -o program program.c" ]
- [ ]     bash snippets are easily extendable
- [ ]   ,f1 new - lets you define a bash comand 
- [ ]   ,f1 bash - lets you execute well in a bash terminal
- [ ]   ,f1 repeat - repeats last command
- [ ]   ,f1 gather console - gets the last command from the console, and saves it in .vim-advantages for selection
- [ ]   ,f1 [hjkl] define target term (left right above below)
- [ ]   [f1-f12] executes and save the executed keystroke

This source needs maintainance.
It will be modular capable of loading in models for integrating with various machines interacting with each other.

It is about toolchains, compilerchains and server management.

# Vim-Advantages
This project is considered a library or plugin
that can be installed with all features if
needed. It provides predefined keyboard mappings and quickly
introduces you to using Vim so you can
develop everything.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not use this repository at this time, as it is under construction.

# Features
- Execution Manager
- Window Manager
- File Completion
- Text Actions

# Remove Accidentally Published Git Content

> [!TIP]
> Did you know how to delete traces of accidentially published content in the git history? 

> [!WARNING]
> Please use the following codes with extreme caution. It is not recommended to do this for shared projects, as the entire git tree will be changed.
> Overwriting the repo history only works with a new clone. I am working on cleaning up the repo in bash, but I need to make sure that no data is lost in the process (e.g., .gitignored files).
> Please work with a new clone if you want to use this bash script.

### Example
```
# remove ./src/Functions.vim from history
git filter-repo --path ./src/Functions.vim --invert-paths
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --prune=now --aggressive
git remote -v
# todo / dynamically gather repository url
git remote add origin {REPO}
github push origin --force --all

# rebase or re-clone
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
```

### Prototype Function
> [!WARNING]
> The snippet is still a work in progress and will be commented very soon.
```
git_remove() {
  paths=""
  echo "# remove $@ from history"
  for p in "$@"; do paths+=" --path "$p; done
  echo "git filter-repo$paths --invert-paths"
  echo "git reflog expire --expire=now --all"
  echo "git gc --prune=now --aggressive"
  echo "git remote -v"
  echo "# todo / dynamically gather repository url"
  echo "git remote add origin {REPO}"
  echo "github push origin --force --all"
  echo ""
  echo "# rebase or re-clone"
  echo "git fetch origin"
  echo "git reset --hard origin/main"
}
```
### Using Generator
```
git_remove ./src/Functions.vim
```

# Build And Install GCC 15
Most linux distros deliver older GCC versions like GCC 12.
Here is, how to compile and install GCC 15.2.0 on your own.
Call the following bash function `build_gcc_15` in a suitable place.
This action takes some time.

```
build_gcc_15() {
  wget https://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/releases/gcc-15.2.0/gcc-15.2.0.tar.xz
  tar -xf gcc-15.2.0.tar.xz
  cd gcc-15.2.0
  ./contrib/download_prerequisites
  mkdir build && cd build
  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/gcc-15 --enable-languages=c,c++ --disable-multilib
  make -j$(nproc)
  sudo make install
  # Add to your path
  echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/gcc-15/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
  source ~/.bashrc
  gcc --version
}
```

# General Project Information
## Why I Prefer Custom Vim Functions
- I usually avoid Vim plugins.
- Vim's scripting language can be risky.
- I prefer writing my own functions.
- Hesitant to dive into others' plugin code.
- Others' scripting skills often impress me.
- Their stable solutions inspire my work.

## Organizing Vim for a Cozy Experience
- My approach keeps Vim editing comfortable.
- Easy to integrate or extend features.
- Newcomers can learn effective Vim techniques.
- Shows how to handle project editing smoothly.
- Demonstrates Vim's flexibility for on-the-fly tweaks.

## Why Vim Stands Out
- Every programming language has unique needs.
- Modifying heavy IDEs feels unpredictable.
- Vim is quick, smart, and suits real programmers.
- A reliable tool for efficient editing.

## Current Progress
- Keeping the code tidy and organized.
- Removing unnecessary code.
- Preparing to upload files soon.
